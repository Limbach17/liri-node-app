Curious when your favorite band is coming to town? Type "concert-this" into the
terminal, followed by the name of a band, and Liri will show you relevant concert information
provided by Bands in Town.

Perhaps you were streaming a song and want to know more about it. Type "spotify-this-song" followed
by the song title to return info about the song, powered by Spotify.

You can also type "movie-this" and the name of a movie to get OMDb data. Basically everything
you will need to know about that movie.

At any point, you can make a new user profile by typing "make-profile", or you can get media info
from an existing profile by typing "read-profile".


Feeling lost? Type "do-what-it-says" and the last command will run.
